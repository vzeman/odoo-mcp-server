## Model Reference

Common Odoo models you can interact with:

- `sale.order` - Sales orders and quotations

## Security Considerations

- Store credentials securely using environment variables
- Use API keys instead of passwords when possible
- Grant minimum necessary permissions to the API user
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor API usage through Odoo's logs

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failed
- Verify your API key is active in Odoo
- Check if the username is correct (usually your email)
- Ensure the database name matches exactly

### Connection Refused
- Verify the Odoo URL (should not include `/web`)
- Check if your IP is whitelisted (if applicable)
- Ensure XML-RPC is enabled on your Odoo instance

### Model Not Found
- The model might require additional modules to be installed
- Use `list_models` to see available models
- Check if you have permissions for that model
